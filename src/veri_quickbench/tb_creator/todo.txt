converter from verilog numbers (8'hxx etc) to python numbers (0x)

does not handle things like this:
input wire [7:0] red, grn, blu,
either fix or throw a more useful error

add in driver code for clocks, resets
add in source and sinks for driving interfaces, see example folder
add appropriate parameters into interface instantiation Ie.  m_axi = intfc.axi(TDATA,...)

possibly move the interfaces into the *_ep.py files...

clocks within or outside of intfc interfaces?

run tests in parallel?
